# About me

My name is **Rodolfo Berrios** and I'm a software engineer from ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± Chile.

I'm the creator of [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com) which is a popular image and video hosting script that powers thousands of websites around the world. I've been working on Chevereto since 2007 and I'm proud to say that it has become a reference in the industry and it is my lifetime project.

I also enjoy doing Open Source software. I'm the creator of [Chevere](https://chevere.org) which a PHP library that aims to deliver high quality packages to enrich the development process and make it more enjoyable. I'm also the creator of [xrDebug](https://xrdebug.com) which a lightweight portable debug utility that helps developers debug their applications with ease.

I am looking for QA-focused contract opportunities. If you're looking to collaborate on projects that require meticulous attention to quality and performance, please feel free to reach out.
