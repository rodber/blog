# About

I'm **Rodolfo Berrios**, I create software products. Welcome to my blog/portfolio, where I share my software projects and insights.

I am the creator of [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com), a leading image and video hosting software that powers thousands of websites worldwide. Since 2007, Chevereto has become a benchmark in the industry and my lifelong project.

Additionally, I developed [Chevere](https://chevere.org), a library designed to provide high-quality packages that enhance the development process, and [xrDebug](https://xrdebug.com), a lightweight, portable debugging utility that simplifies application debugging for developers.
