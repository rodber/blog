After two years on development, I'm thrilled to announce that the [Workflow](https://chevere.org/packages/workflow) package has finally reached its stable **1.0 release**. This means that the package is now safe for production usage, offering a robust and reliable solution for managing workflows in PHP applications.

```php
use function Chevere\Workflow\sync;
use function Chevere\Workflow\response;
use function Chevere\Workflow\variable;
use function Chevere\Workflow\workflow;

workflow(
    thumb: async(
        new ImageResize(),
        image: variable('image'),
        width: 100,
        height: 100,
        fit: 'thumb'
    ),
    medium: async(
        new ImageResize(),
        image: variable('image'),
        width: 500,
        fit: 'resizeByW'
    ),
    store: sync(
        new StoreFiles(),
        response('thumb', 'filename'),
        response('medium', 'filename'),
    ),
);
```

The Workflow package is designed to help developers create, manage, and execute workflows with ease. It features a clean codebase, comprehensive tests, high test coverage, and mutation testing, ensuring that the package meets the highest quality standards.

I've covered all its functionality in the [original post](../2022/2022-04-09-workflow-php.md), so I won't repeat it here.

Key features of the Workflow package include:

- **Ease of Use**: Simple and intuitive API for defining and managing workflows.
- **Flexibility**: Supports complex workflows with multiple steps and conditions.
- **Reliability**: Thoroughly tested with high coverage and mutation testing to ensure stability.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance to handle large workflows efficiently.
