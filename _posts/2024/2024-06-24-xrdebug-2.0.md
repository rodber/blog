The newest [xrDebug](https://xrdebug.com) release comes packed with significant improvements that streamline your debugging process. This version introduces foldable dumps and a scrollable backtrace, both designed to enhance usability and efficiency.

## Foldable Dumps

Thanks to the integration with [VarDump 2.0](./2024-06-03-chevere-var-dump-2.0.md), xrDebug now supports foldable dumps. This feature allows you to easily navigate and manage complex objects and data structures by collapsing and expanding sections as needed. Even better, this feature was implemented at no additional cost, as it was ported directly from [chevere/var-dump](https://github.com/chevere/var-dump). It‚Äôs a perfect example of efficiency and resourcefulness.

Check out the foldable dumps in action in the following clip:

</div>

## Scrollable backtrace

I've improved the backtrace display. With the new resizable DIV and scrollable functionality, xrDebug presents a compact, adjustable stack trace display. This allows you to customize the height for optimal viewing and comfort, making it easier to track and debug issues without being overwhelmed by lengthy stack traces.

See the scrollable backtrace feature in action in the following clip:
