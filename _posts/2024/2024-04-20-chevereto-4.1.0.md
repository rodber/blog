One year and seven months ago I introduced [Chevereto 4](https://rodolfoberrios.com/2022/09/20/chevereto-4/) (Macanudo). It was the biggest Chevereto release ever, took about five years of work and compromised an entire code rewrite which is progressively happening.

Macanudo was the first step for next gen Chevereto and today I’m very proud for presenting the next iteration: **Chevereto “Pulento” V4.1**.

## How Pulento?

The term [pulento](https://dle.rae.es/pulento) is [Chilean slang](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pulento), it means "wonderful", “magnificent”, "excellent", "powerful" among other opulent meanings. I took this word as the codename as it represents my dedication with Chevereto and how I want the world to know about it, how I want you to refer to my work.

Chevereto is *Pulento* because it **now supports video** which opens a complete new world of possibilities and content sharing. All fits right in place as video support seamless integrate with the existing software system and user interface. As freedom is our motto at Chevereto there's **no limits** at all with support for videos of **any length and size**, you can host 1-second videos up to full length movies.

Forget hosting your videos on paywalled, ad-based and heavy surveyed services like YouTube or Instagram. **You, your content and your visitors are not the product here**, I don't have any business tracking your activity on any level.

On *Pulento* I'm starting the process of delivering the **user-based API** which will gradually turn Chevereto into a **headless CMS**. No time for monkey-patching a pile of third-party services to build a software system, our API will enable you to build full-fledged software without leaving the same API and thanks to Chevereto's massive feature set you will be able to craft unique experiences and shadow any existing media-based application.

## Video support

🎥 Chevereto now supports video content.

To support video in an system born for image sharing is not trivial. It requires different handling and it represents another order of magnitude for storage and CDN concerns as a single video could require more space than an entire photo album. That’s why on *Pulento* **External Storage functionality has been improved** to limit the media type allowed, enabling to setup separated dedicated performant storage for all your allowed media types.

![storage type modal](/photos/2024/chevereto-4.1.0/storage-type-modal.png)

Video requires FFMPEG and when I first survey this feature (circa 2014) I noticed that it wasn’t common neither performant enough for mainstream server hardware. Ten years later I’m very happy and surprised with how performant and fast FFMPEG runs now, it fits perfect for our need. Thanks to this on *Pulento* there’s **no limits on video** (application layer) although is very likely that later on I will add admin-configurable soft restrictions on video duration.

```php
$frameFile = Upload::getTempNam(sys_get_temp_dir());
$ffmpeg = FFMpeg::create();
$video = $ffmpeg->open($file);
$video
    ->frame(TimeCode::fromSeconds($time))
    ->save($frameFile);
```

Video requires to generate and store a video frame, a raster image which represents the video. This image is used as video poster and at listings. To store that frame I needed to tweak the `image_chain` database attribute, which is a decimal representation of a the **binary tree** which I use to determine the images (sizes) available for each upload. Here’s the table (part of it):

![image chain](/photos/2024/chevereto-4.1.0/image-chain.png)

The addition won’t conflict with the previous chain, that’s the whole point of using a binary representation.

Embedding needed modification as video requires to use the `<video>` HTML tag. As there’s no video embed for BBCode and Markdown I had to workaround a poly-fill based on using the video frame and linking it to the video viewer page. It is likely that later on I will add support for **third-party video players** to circumvent the limitations of HTML video.

![embed image video](/photos/2024/chevereto-4.1.0/embed-image-video.png)

To upload video using the web browser it requires to read the video. I needed to tweak the loading function and canvas preview generation to understand video content. On this regard web browsers limit a bit this functionality to WebM and MP4. This is a case where the user-based API becomes more relevant, as the API won’t be limited by the web browser **enabling to upload more formats** in the future. With dedicated applications powered by Chevereto's API I could support any media format, and that's what exactly I'm going to do.

![video edit](/photos/2024/chevereto-4.1.0/video-edit.png)

This is an ongoing development, I’m sure that we will get a lot of sweet video-related updates in the future as users contribute their ideas and needs. I’m eager to see how users help me to shape the best self-hosted media sharing platform with Chevereto.

## User-based API

🥑 Use and send commands to Chevereto from *anywhere*.

By being a web application Chevereto is available everywhere, but constrained to the web browser. In the early days this was a serious issue but thankfully web technology has evolved to a point where web browsers works "pretty much the same" but the constrains that worried me are still there and I'm done with it, technology won't improve any further.

This is because web browsers have limited resources, local storage, cache and many other caveats that have jailed Chevereto for too long. My goal is to get Chevereto **free of all these boundaries** and the only way to achieve that is turning Chevereto into a headless CMS.

But Chevereto is *MASSIVE* as you may expect from any system that has about two decades of active development. Because of this the process must be progressive and you can read about it at [User-based API announcement](https://blog.chevereto.com/upcoming/user-based-api/).

## Customizable theme font

👻 Easy select Chevereto system font to fit your style.

Chevereto uses Helvetica by default and while it looks gorgeous there are several use cases where a different font may **suit better for your needs**. If your brand or product identifies with a given font type then being able to easy customize the system font becomes more relevant.

![font selection](/photos/2024/chevereto-4.1.0/font-selection.png)

With *Pulento* you can choose from a wide selection of safe zero-load web fonts including sans-serif, serif, monospace and more.
