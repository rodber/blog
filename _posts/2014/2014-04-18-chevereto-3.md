I can't think in anything else in which I worked that hard and for such a long period of time, at least by my own without any help at all. That project is [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com) V3.

When I started to develop this version the goal wasn't remotely close to the final working product ([you can see it here](https://demo.chevereto.com)) and to be honest, I've always loved to work in Chevereto more than anything else, with the exception of Junkstr, and soon as I started to work on this third major release I decided to highly increase the bar regardless of the time and the complexity of the project.

I don't know if you feel or see the same as I do but for me it is an amazing system and I'm so proud of it and I'm happy to keep feeling this when I release something.

Long life to the #1 image sharing script in the world.
