Remember the [framework](../2013/2013-09-02-the-g-library.md) thing I was talking mentioned in a previous post?

Long time ago I started to learn and working with [PHP](https://php.net/). It started mostly because I needed a way to make real my ideas and it was the most used web programming language in that days. It was a self learned thing which was actually a very long process and it also included other languages and web development technologies. Several year later PHP is still the most used web programming language and I keep working with it.

I've made [Chevereto](https://chevereto.com/) my trademark using PHP and I have plans for other scripts based in PHP so when I started to code the upcoming new major release of Chevereto I knew that I was ready to make a framework for my projects. The result was which is an Open Source PHP framework which summarize all this years of learning and is the foundation for the next following years.

Actually I never liked frameworks until I noticed [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) which isn't a framework but I loved how jQuery was all about making certain core task better than anyone at least in those days. Remember that back in the day there was a lot of JS libraries like MooTools, Scriptaculous, etc. Well, I started with this last one and even when its effects were way better than jQuery it didn't perform well the core tasks or make the syntax more simpler. That was where jQuery owned with its sleek an intuitive syntax to perform really casual stuff but also do more complex things.

For me frameworks are not about how many things they can do out of the box but how easy is to go big with it. A good framework is the one that helps you to perform core tasks and makes your coding less hassle so you can focus in the actual features of your app. G\ was coded with this philosophy in mind and it was developed side by side with Chevereto V3 so actually is not a work in progress but a real working thing.

G\ Library website has an intuitive documentation that will teach you the basic stuff and you can also get the code on GitHub. Hope that developers out there find G\ useful as I do and collaboration is welcome.
