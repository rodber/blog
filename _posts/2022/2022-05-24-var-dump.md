New from [Chevere](https://chevere.org) is the [chevere/var-dump](https://chevere.org/packages/var-dump) package for PHP. This software provides a modern [var_dump](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-dump.php) alternative, with a myriad of options to support generating documents for HTML, console and plain-text.

Symfony provides a nice [VarDumper](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/var_dumper.html) component which is the industry-standard. **Why build another one?**

To my taste, Symfony's dump output looks pale and dated. You can tell that it was made for another time as it seeks to chop on representation, it rely on symbols as the removal of the modifier keyword to use `-property` to denote the property visibility. It uses quotes to indicate `"string"` instead of explicit print the type, a float or integer is anything that _looks like_ that. There's no type information except for objects.

To create an alternative has been a long term goal and I'm happy to present **VarDump**, my new modern `var_dump` alternative for PHP focused in üëç types, üåà color highlighting and üì¶ portability.
