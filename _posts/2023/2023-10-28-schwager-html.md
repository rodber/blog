New from Chevere is the Schwager HTML package. This software creates a HTML document representation for [Schwager API](https://chevere.org/packages/schwager.html), a human friendly readable user interface easier to the eye and more comfortable to work with.

The package is available at [chevere/schwager-html](https://github.com/chevere/schwager-html). It looks like this:

There's a [live demo](https://chevere.github.io/schwager-html/demo/output/schwager.html) which I've embedded here:

<div class="iframe-container rainbow-box"><iframe border="0" loading="lazy" src="https://chevere.github.io/schwager-html/demo/output/schwager.html"></iframe></div>

This package uses bootstrap, features a theme which follows system preferences (day/night) and it has sticky headers which help when working on complex routes with many endpoints.
