New from Chevere is the [Http package](https://chevere.org/packages/http). This software provides tooling for building HTTP components.

## Http Controller

The [Http Controller](https://chevere.org/packages/http#controller) is built on top of the [Controller](https://chevere.org/packages/action#controller) component and it enables to define the I/O of an HTTP endpoint, with support for [query string](https://chevere.org/packages/http#accept-query), [body](https://chevere.org/packages/http#accept-body), [file uploads](https://chevere.org/packages/http#accept-files) and path variables, which can be hinted using [StringAttr](https://chevere.org/packages/parameter#string) attribute.

```php
use Chevere\Attribute\StringRegex;
use Chevere\Http\Controller;

class MyController extends Controller
{
    public function run(
        #[StringRegex('/^[0-9]{2}$/')]
        string $id
    ): array
    {
        return [];
    }
}
```

## Attributes

The Http package provides general use-case attributes, designed to be used at both Controller and Middleware.

With attributes is easier to separate concerns and to drive tailored system needs.

### Header attribute

With the [Header attribute](https://chevere.org/packages/http#header) you can define multiple response header lines:

```php
use Chevere\Http\Attributes\Header;

#[
    Header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment'),
    Header('Content-Type', 'application/json')
]
```

Use function `classHeaders` to get a list of Header attributes for a given class.

### Status attribute

With the [Status attribute](https://chevere.org/packages/http#status) you can indicate response status codes:

```php
use Chevere\Http\Attributes\Status;

#[Status(200, 404)]
```

Use function `classStatus` to get a the Status attribute for a given class.

## Exceptions

The Http package provides exceptions for both Http Controller and Middleware with `ControllerException` and `MiddlewareException` respectively.

I added these because I don't like using middleware to stop a request by returning a [new response](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/#13-generating-responses) as I prefer throwing a known exception at the affected concern. This enables to drop an unwanted extra responsibility.
